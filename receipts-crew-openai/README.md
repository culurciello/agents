# extract data from receipts images with Crew.ai and OpenAI  


This application processes receipts using two crew.ai agents: a receipt vision model and a writer model. Both use openAI gpt-4o-mini model.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/crew_test_openai/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/crew_test_openai/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/crew_test_openai/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/crew_test_openai/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the crew-test-openai Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## DOES IT WORK:

YES it works great and here is an example output:

```
$ crewai run
